# PROJECT DAYDREAM
# Technical Review 1

## Synthesis

### Issues raised
- Indico vs OpenCV (resolved)
 - We will be doing primary experimentation in OpenCV. Reasons for this choice include:
   - Less latency 
   - Does not require networking
   - Trainability (open to learning and refinement)
 - Drawbacks:
   - Hard to train specifically


- False positives / frame handling
-- Implement a two-second delay so that an animation does not trigger prematurely
--- Once the delay passes successfully, the animation sequence becomes uninterruptible - cutting out mid-way will not be possible.


- Teaming 
-- Feature development should be pre-agreed upon
-- Decide on features for each subteam to work on in parallel 
-- Open communication and making sure that everyone is receiving notifications from the Slack channel
-- Trello/project management platform 


## Post-review discoveries


- Other APIs
Other compatible APIs were found as a result of our continuing process to search for a suitable platform - one such platform is the YOLO Project (link below)
http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ 


- Multi-tasking
Class instantiation is required to detect multiple objects and initialize parallel counters for their animation processes
System diagram should be updated to reflect the multi-object recognition capability required of the project
Demo was able to detect multiple objects (in OpenCV)


## Process reflection

- Overall, we were able to communicate the intents and objectives of the project to the audience.
- We were also really proud that we had functionality prior to the technical review and were able to live-demo.
- We got feedback for our key questions, but they were not necessarily as in-depth as we would have liked.
One potential cause for this problem is that our questions were not open-ended enough
I.e. OpenCV vs. Indico?
The lack of depth in our questions contributed to the limited responses we received
- Notably, our system diagram did not account for multi-tasking functionality - something which we realized after the discussion process.
Although it can be fixed (discussed more above), we feel that this was a glaring error branching from our lack of attention to detail in our technical review.


- Next time:
We will organize this more cohesively by using slide decks
We will practice more specifically what we are going to say and whoâ€™s going to say it.
We will continue to use demos whenever possible, to illustrate our progress and ideation translation
However, we will try to ask more discussion-spurring questions about our demos.
